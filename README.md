# 🔥 Autonomous Fire Fighting Drone

## A functional, affordable, and easily buildable drone capable of searching an area, detecting a heat source, and deploying a payload.

This senior capstone project's objective was to create a drone that could autonomously search a designated area, locate a simulated fire using a thermal camera, and drop a simulated fire suppressant. Each team was given only the following components: an **Arduino**, a **thermal camera**, a **transmitter/receiver**, and an **IMU**.

### 🛠️ Key Design Principles

Our team focused on four core physical design goals:

- ✅ Fully 3D-printed frame
- 🛒 Easily obtainable parts from Amazon and other fast-shipping retailers
- 🧩 Modular, repairable design
- ⚡ Clean and efficient wire management

### 💡 Design Rationale

We learned from previous teams and intentionally focused on keeping costs low while maintaining performance. This is why we opted for:

- A **fully 3D-printed frame** to reduce cost and allow rapid repairs.
- Components sourced from reliable suppliers like **Amazon** and **GetFPV**, even if slightly more expensive, to avoid long lead times.
- A **modular design** where every part was independently printable and replaceable—so if an arm broke, it could be swapped in hours, not weeks.
- Careful **wire management**, which significantly influenced the baseplate and arm design. We routed ESC wiring cleanly through the frame for both aesthetics and safety.
